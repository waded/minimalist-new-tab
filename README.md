# minimalist-new-tab

A Chrome & Edge extension that removes distractions on new tabs.

If you want to search, or go to a recent or favorite sites, just type in
the address bar. Your cursor's already there.

## Planned improvements

- Final icons. The current icons are for testing purposes.
- Detection of browser dark mode to choose a white vs. black background.
  Until this is possible (Chrome >=75) new tabs are a neutral gray. Although
  gray's not ideal it won't blind or shove you into darkness unexpectedly.
