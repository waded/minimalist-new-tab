# minimalist-new-tab

This Chrome/Edge extension removes all distractions on new tabs. No news, no weather, no favorite sites, no photos. Nothing but blank.

If you want to search, or go to recent/favorite sites, just type in the address bar.

## Published versions

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimalist-new-tab/jlfccaehbgdjemooelbpkmnogjacnjbf)

## Planned improvements

- Adjust to your preference for dark mode (waiting for [support
  for detecting the mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme), and until then
  new tabs are gray instead of light/dark)
- Invert icons in dark mode (waiting [for support in manifest or automatically](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=893175), rather than adding a preference specific to this extension)
- Localization of "New tab"
